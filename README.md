# Serverless Framework Exercises
An introduction to AWS Lambdas and the serverless framework
## Getting Started
Following these instructions will result in you having a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them. These instructions currently assume that you are working on Apple hardware using OSX.

In order to get the most value of this tutorial, you should fork a copy of this repository to your own GitHub account. This will allow you to follow all the instructions and have a workspace you can use to build your first serverless API.
#### Optional Software
The following pieces of software _*MAY*_ be installed but are completely optional.

Homebrew - This is a commonly used package manager for OSX. It will allow you to install, upgrade and manage many useful applications that can be installed on your machine. We include instructions to use it to install various pieces of software so please adjust accordingly if you already use a different package manager.

Editor - This can be anything from the built in editor provided by OSX to a full fledged IDE such as IntelliJ. You are free to use any editor of your choosing as the project is not dependent on any particular editor.

Serverless Framework - Framework used by this tutorial to create AWS Lambda functions. It comes as a NodeJS package so we will use the Node Package Manager (NPM) to install it.

In a terminal run
```bash
npm install -g serverless
```
## Now the fun begins!
Now that you have installed all the necessary software, it's time to get into the code and build yourself a serverless API the instructions for which are linked to below. Good luck and happy coding...
